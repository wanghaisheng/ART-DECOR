DECOR (Data Elements, Codes, OIDs and Rules) is a methodology to record the information model used by health professionals. DECOR uses this model to generate various artifacts: documentation, XML- and test-tooling, etc. With DECOR it is possible to improve the recorded information model by generating and resolving issues per item. DECOR registers (amongst others) datasets, datatypes, valuesets, codes, identifications, and business rules. The underlying data-format is XML. Generation of HTML-documentation and XML-materials is possible through transformations with stylesheets.

ART (Advanced Requirement Tooling) is the DECOR user interface to create and adapt DECOR files, and to generate artifacts from DECOR files. ART is based on the eXist XML database, XQuery and Orbeon XForms.
